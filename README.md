  # Front End

### I love exploring new ideas in web development and learning new techniques.


## Book Store

##### This was a school project. I drew the background image in Krita. This was built with HTML and CSS.

## Architecture site

##### Another school project. I often lean into the dark theme and wanted to completely challenge myself to build the opposite. I planned the site with Figma and the site was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

##### The posts are fetched from an API and dynamically load as the user scrolls further on the page. Each post has comments left by users.
